            <h2>I like to make sounds.</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I have been obsessed with sound and music since I got my first Yamaha keyboard and access to a computer with Fruity Loops 3 at age 8. My best friends in the world are the people I make sounds and music with.</p>

            <h2>I like to make games.</h2>
               <p>I have a deep-rooted love for early video games and internet aesthetics. The inherent weirdness of some original Playstation games, as well as the spaces in Worlds Online, Active Worlds, and other early 3D online chat rooms are my favorite things to explore artistically.
               </p>
               <p>A few of my friends and I formed a creative collective called MEAT BOG that we use as a label for our music releases, and we have since started acting as a game development studio. Our first major project is a low-poly game that hearkens back to Playstation 1 era and early 3D PC games. It is planned to be some combination of a roleplaying game, horror game, and bizarre art installation.</p>

               <p>This current project involves a "mall" or "cathedral" type building made with early internet aesthetics in mind. Each corner of this uhhhhhh Carrot Cake Malice Temple(???) loops a different song.</p>
